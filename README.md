- [CSS, SCSS](https://github.com/wealthsimple/styleguides/blob/master/CSS.md)
- [JavaScript, Angular](https://github.com/wealthsimple/styleguides/blob/master/JavaScript.md) - in progress

# Core principles

Below are some language-independent guidelines.

## Table of Contents
  1. [Line Length](#line-length)
  1. [Commenting](#commenting)
    1. [File/class-level comments](#fileclass-level-comments)
    1. [Function comments](#function-comments)
    1. [Block and inline comments](#block-and-inline-comments)
    1. [Commented-out code](#commented-out-code)
  1. [Be Consistent](#be-consistent)

## Line Length

* Keep each line of code to a readable length. Unless
  you have a reason to, keep lines to fewer than 100 characters.
    <sup>[[link](#line-length)]</sup>

## Commenting

> Though a pain to write, comments are absolutely vital to keeping our code
> readable. The following rules describe what you should comment and where. But
> remember: while comments are very important, the best code is
> self-documenting. Giving sensible names to types and variables is much better
> than using obscure names that you must then explain through comments.

> When writing your comments, write for your audience: the next contributor who
> will need to understand your code. Be generous — the next one may be you!

Portions of this section borrow heavily from the Google
[C++][google-c++-comments] and [Python][google-python-comments] style guides.

### File/class-level comments

Every class definition should have an accompanying comment that describes what
it is for and how it should be used.

A file that contains zero classes or more than one class should have a comment
at the top describing its contents.

```ruby
# Automatic conversion of one locale to another where it is possible, like
# American to British English.
module Translation
  # Class for converting between text between similar locales.
  # Right now only conversion between American English -> British, Canadian,
  # Australian, New Zealand variations is provided.
  class PrimAndProper
    def initialize
      @converters = { :en => { :"en-AU" => AmericanToAustralian.new,
                               :"en-CA" => AmericanToCanadian.new,
                               :"en-GB" => AmericanToBritish.new,
                               :"en-NZ" => AmericanToKiwi.new,
                             } }
    end

  ...

  # Applies transforms to American English that are common to
  # variants of all other English colonies.
  class AmericanToColonial
    ...
  end

  # Converts American to British English.
  # In addition to general Colonial English variations, changes "apartment"
  # to "flat".
  class AmericanToBritish < AmericanToColonial
    ...
  end
```

All files, including data and config files, should have file-level comments.

```ruby
# List of American-to-British spelling variants.
#
# This list is made with
# lib/tasks/list_american_to_british_spelling_variants.rake.
#
# It contains words with general spelling variation patterns:
#   [trave]led/lled, [real]ize/ise, [flav]or/our, [cent]er/re, plus
# and these extras:
#   learned/learnt, practices/practises, airplane/aeroplane, ...

sectarianizes: sectarianises
neutralization: neutralisation
...
```

### Function comments

Every function declaration should have comments immediately preceding it that
describe what the function does and how to use it. These comments should be
descriptive ("Opens the file") rather than imperative ("Open the file"); the
comment describes the function, it does not tell the function what to do. In
general, these comments do not describe how the function performs its task.
Instead, that should be left to comments interspersed in the function's code.

Every function should mention what the inputs and outputs are, unless it meets
all of the following criteria:

* not externally visible
* very short
* obvious

You may use whatever format you wish. In Ruby, two popular function
documentation schemes are [TomDoc](http://tomdoc.org/) and
[YARD](http://rubydoc.info/docs/yard/file/docs/GettingStarted.md). You can also
just write things out concisely:

```ruby
# Returns the fallback locales for the_locale.
# If opts[:exclude_default] is set, the default locale, which is otherwise
# always the last one in the returned list, will be excluded.
#
# For example:
#   fallbacks_for(:"pt-BR")
#     => [:"pt-BR", :pt, :en]
#   fallbacks_for(:"pt-BR", :exclude_default => true)
#     => [:"pt-BR", :pt]
def fallbacks_for(the_locale, opts = {})
  ...
end
```

### Block and inline comments

The final place to have comments is in tricky parts of the code. If you're
going to have to explain it at the next code review, you should comment it now.
Complicated operations get a few lines of comments before the operations
commence. Non-obvious ones get comments at the end of the line.

```ruby
def fallbacks_for(the_locale, opts = {})
  # dup() to produce an array that we can mutate.
  ret = @fallbacks[the_locale].dup

  # We make two assumptions here:
  # 1) There is only one default locale (that is, it has no less-specific
  #    children).
  # 1) The default locale is just a language. (Like :en, and not :"en-US".)
  if opts[:exclude_default] &&
      ret.last == default_locale &&
      ret.last != language_from_locale(the_locale)
    ret.pop
  end

  ret
end
```

On the other hand, never describe the code. Assume the person reading the code
knows the language (though not what you're trying to do) better than you do.

### Commented-out code

* <a name="commented-code"></a>Never leave commented-out code in our codebase.

## Be Consistent

> If you're editing code, take a few minutes to look at the code around you and
> determine its style. If they use spaces around all their arithmetic
> operators, you should too. If their comments have little boxes of hash marks
> around them, make your comments have little boxes of hash marks around them
> too.

> The point of having style guidelines is to have a common vocabulary of coding
> so people can concentrate on what you're saying rather than on how you're
> saying it. We present global style rules here so people know the vocabulary,
> but local style is also important. If code you add to a file looks
> drastically different from the existing code around it, it throws readers out
> of their rhythm when they go to read it. Avoid this.
